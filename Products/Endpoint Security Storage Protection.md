# Endpoint Security Storage Protection

## Product Overview
Endpoint Security Storage Protection (ENS SP) detects and removes viruses, malware, and other potentially unwanted software programs from your network-attached storage (NAS) devices.

Endpoint Security Storage Protection (ENS SP) is added to McAfee Endpoint Security and expands its capability. The software performs remote scanning on NAS devices such as NetApp filers and Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) storage appliances

## Usage
We want to scan our NetApp storage all the time, so we will configure a NetApp scanner server (regular server with the ENS SP installed) and assign an ENS SP policy telling him how to scan the NetApp
