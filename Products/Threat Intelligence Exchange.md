# McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange

## Product Overview
McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) optimizes threat prevention by narrowing the gap from malware encounter to containment from days, weeks, and months down to milliseconds.

TIE quickly analyzes files and content from several sources in your environment and makes informed security decisions. These decisions are based on a file's security reputation and the criteria set by you.

TIE manages multiple devices and systems intelligently, so that security information is shared. These devices and systems include the cloud, BYOD, managed nodes, servers, and network appliances.
